* Applied patch by Gordon Thiesfeld which fixes broken Time class compatibility

* General clean-up, including:
  - renamed several methods on PDate
  - renamed 'dateprecisiontest.rb' to 'dprecisiontest.rb'

* Fixed Object.id deprecation warning


== Version 0.2.0

* Fixed Schedule class
* Renamed Schedule#is_occurring? to Schedule#include?
* RAA deployment
* GEM deployment
* Renamed file dateprecisiontest.rb to dprecisiontest.rb

  - minute -> min
  - hour_of_day -> hour
  - day_of_month -> day

== Version 0.1.0

* Inspired by suggestions[http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/95465] on c.l.r., did massive renaming and refactoring to make source more Ruby-esque:

  - TemporalExpression class => TExpr
  - DatePrecision module => DPrecision (file name changed also)
  - TimePoint class => PDate (file name changed also)
  - Added transparent use of bitwise set operators ( & , | ) for building composite expressions
  - Added transparent use of - operator for diff expressions

* Updated TE Tutorial to reflect new and improved syntax usage
* Skipped several version numbers to celebrate

== Version 0.0.6

* TE Tutorial
* Website beautification
* Credits

== Version 0.0.4

* RubyForge project setup
* Basic implementation of the Java-based chronicJ[http://chronicJ.org] functionality in Ruby
